# 🤖 NetReach.AI — Cold Outreach Assistant

**NetReach.AI** is an AI-powered web tool designed to help students and job seekers write **personalized, non-generic cold emails** for networking, referrals, resume feedback, and coffee chats. Instead of using rigid templates or robotic AI replies, NetReach focuses on authenticity by guiding users through structured input and leveraging GPT models to generate warm, human-sounding outreach messages.
